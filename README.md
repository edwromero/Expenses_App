# expenses_app

A little look at what an expense application would be. In this journey I have focused on functionality, trying to specify everything that "Function" refers to. 

What is applied:

-Basic functions of the application (Float Button,AppBarButton,calendar, add item, remove item)

-Recognition of time and date.

-Calendar display button

-Calendar with visualization of daily and weekly expenses.

-AppRecicleCycle.

-Cupertino class.

-Responsiveness in general.

Next steps:

100% responsiveness

Login page and registration of new users.

Sidebar with user options and general settings.
